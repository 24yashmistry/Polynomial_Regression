# Polynomial Regression Learning Repository

This repository is created for the purpose of learning Polynomial Regression through a step-by-step process. Polynomial Regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable (X) and dependent variable (Y) is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.

## Introduction

Polynomial Regression is a powerful technique in the field of machine learning and statistics that allows us to capture non-linear relationships between variables. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Polynomial Regression.

## Contents

1. **Data Preparation**: Guidelines on how to prepare and preprocess data for Polynomial Regression.
2. **Model Training**: Step-by-step process of training a Polynomial Regression model using various libraries such as scikit-learn in Python.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Techniques for evaluating the performance of the trained model, including metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error.
4. **Visualization**: Visualizing the Polynomial Regression model and its predictions using matplotlib or other plotting libraries.

## Requirements

- Python (3.x recommended)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualization)
